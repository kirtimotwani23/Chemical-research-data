Major brands like <strong>Lotte Chemical</strong> and <strong>Hyosung TNC</strong> are investing heavily in recycled plastic production, targeting a <strong>30% reduction in virgin plastic use</strong> by 2030. The domestic packaging industry now sources <strong>25% of materials from recycled plastics</strong>, up from just 12% in 2020.</p><p><strong>3. Technological Breakthroughs:</strong><br>
Advanced sorting technologies like <strong>AI-powered NIR spectroscopy</strong> and <strong>enzymatic depolymerization</strong> have boosted recycling efficiency by over 40%. Notably, South Korean researchers recently developed a <strong>low-energy chemical recycling method</strong> that processes mixed plastics at 30% lower costs than conventional methods.</p><p>Despite strong momentum, several obstacles persist:</p><p><strong>1. High-Value Recyclates:</strong><br>
The market for <strong>food-grade rPET</strong> is growing at <strong>9.2% annually</strong>, with beverage companies replacing 50% of virgin PET with recycled content to meet sustainability targets.</p><p><strong>2. Chemical Recycling Expansion:</strong><br>
Investments in pyrolysis and gasification technologies are expected to triple processing capacity to <strong>300,000 tons annually</strong> by 2026, making complex plastics like multi-layer packaging economically viable to recycle.</p><p><strong>3. Smart Collection Systems:</strong><br>
Seoulâs <strong>RFID-based volume-rate waste system</strong> has increased plastic collection efficiency by 45%. Nationwide implementation could generate <strong>$120 million annually</strong> in reclaimed material value.</p><p>The market features a mix of conglomerates and specialized recyclers:</p><p>This analysis comes from comprehensive research on South Koreaâs Plastic Recycling Market (2024-2030), featuring:
