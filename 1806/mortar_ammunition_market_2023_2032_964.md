<h1>Mortar Ammunition Market ,Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>mortar ammunition market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>US$ 87.46 million in 2023 to US$ 133.36 million by 2030</strong>, exhibiting a steady <strong>CAGR of 5.04% during 2024-2030</strong>. This growth trajectory emerges despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply chain recalibrations affecting defense procurement cycles globally.</p><p>Mortar systems remain indispensable assets for modern armed forces, offering <strong>portable indirect fire support with rapid deployment capabilities</strong>. The 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm variants collectively account for <strong>89% of military mortar systems in active service</strong>, with recent conflicts demonstrating their continued tactical relevance in urban warfare scenarios.</p><p><strong>1. Modernization of Ground Forces:</strong><br>
Military modernization programs across NATO and allied nations are driving demand. The U.S. Army's <strong>Next Generation Squad Weapon program</strong> alone has allocated $4.7 billion for light weapons modernization, creating spillover demand for compatible mortar systems. European defense budgets now average <strong>2.11% of GDP</strong>, exceeding NATO targets for the first time since 2014.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

The tactical flexibility of mortar systems has regained prominence, evidenced by their extensive use in the Ukraine conflict. Ukrainian forces reportedly fired <strong>3,000-5,000 mortar rounds daily</strong> during peak engagements, demonstrating the system's staying power despite drone and artillery advancements. This has triggered <strong>37% higher procurement inquiries</strong> from Southeast Asian and Eastern European militaries.</p><p><strong>3. Smart Munitions Integration:</strong><br>
While traditional rounds dominate current inventories, GPS-guided mortar munitions are gaining traction, with <strong>23% of R&amp;D budgets</strong> now allocated to precision strike capabilities. Recent tests of the Raytheon-Pratt &amp; Whitney XM1113 rocket-assisted round demonstrated <strong>500-meter CEP improvements</strong> over legacy systems.</p><p>Market growth faces several constraints requiring careful management:</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:</strong> The global ammunition supply chain remains <strong>48% dependent</strong> on a handful of nitrocellulose producers, creating single-point failure risks. Recent price volatility in ammonium nitrate precursors has caused <strong>17-22% cost fluctuations</strong> in mortar round production since 2021.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Complexities:</strong> ITAR and EU Dual-Use regulations add <strong>9-14 months</strong> to export licensing timelines for cross-border defense contracts. Smaller manufacturers report <strong>28% longer sales cycles</strong> compared to pre-2020 benchmarks.</p><p><strong>Technology Absorption Gaps:</strong> While major powers invest in smart munitions, <strong>63% of developing militaries</strong> still rely entirely on legacy systems due to budgetary constraints and lack of digital fire control integration capabilities.</p><p><strong>1. Multi-Role Munition Development:</strong><br>
Convergence technologies enabling single rounds to perform HE, smoke, and illumination functions are gaining investor attention. The UK MOD's recently tested <strong>multi-effect 81mm round</strong> demonstrated a <strong>40% reduction</strong> in logistical footprint during field trials.</p><p><strong>2. Additive Manufacturing Breakthroughs:</strong><br>
3D-printed mortar components now achieve <strong>93% of forged steel performance</strong> at <strong>30% lower weight</strong>, according to recent Rheinmetall tests. This enables embedded electronics for smart fuzing without compromising structural integrity.</p><p><strong>3. Regional Production Partnerships:</strong><br>
The "friend-shoring" trend has spurred <strong>19 new joint ventures</strong> since 2022 between Western primes and Asian/Middle Eastern manufacturers. These collaborations aim to bypass export restrictions while meeting local content requirements averaging <strong>55-60%</strong> in emerging markets.</p><p><strong>Autonomy Integration:</strong> Loitering mortar munitions with <strong>20-30 minute endurance</strong> are transitioning from concept to procurement, with Elbit Systems' FireWeeder demonstrating <strong>95% target engagement accuracy</strong> in recent Middle Eastern trials.</p><p><strong>Environmental Compliance Pressures:</strong> The <strong>Perfluoroalkyl (PFAS) phase-out</strong> mandate is driving reformulation of incendiary compositions, with BAE Systems reporting successful <strong>PFAS-free smoke round tests</strong> meeting all obscuration requirements.</p><p><strong>Counter-Drone Adaptations:</strong> Airburst mortar rounds optimized for <strong>Group 1-3 UAS threats</strong> now account for <strong>15% of RFP requirements</strong> compared to just 3% in 2020, reflecting evolving battlefield priorities.</p><p>The market features a blend of <strong>established defense primes and specialized munitions firms</strong>. Northrop Grumman maintains technological leadership in precision-guided variants, while Nammo dominates NATO-standard training round supply with <strong>43% market share</strong>.</p><p>Recent years have seen <strong>vertical integration</strong> among second-tier players, with Rostec acquiring <strong>two Balkan propellant plants</strong> to secure upstream supply chains. Meanwhile, Asian manufacturers like Poongsan are gaining ground through <strong>cost-competitive steel-cased rounds</strong> priced 28-35% below Western equivalents.</p><p><strong>By Caliber:</strong></p><p><strong>By Round Type:</strong></p><p>This assessment draws from the comprehensive market study <em>Global Mortar Ammunition Outlook 2024-2030</em>, incorporating defense procurement data, manufacturer interviews, and technological readiness evaluations across 32 key markets.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
