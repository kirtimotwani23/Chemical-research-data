<h1>Mordenite Market Research Report 2025,Global Forecast to 2032</h1><p>The global <strong>mordenite market</strong> is projected to expand from <strong>USD 214 million in 2023 to USD 364.63 million by 2032</strong>, growing at a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.10%</strong> during the forecast period. As a high-silica zeolite with versatile chemical properties, mordenite plays a critical role in petroleum refining, chemical processing, and environmental applications, driving sustained demand across industrial sectors.</p><p><strong>1. Expansion in Petroleum Refining:</strong><br>
With global refinery capacities projected to increase by <strong>7.4% by 2030</strong>, mordenite's role in hydrocracking and isomerization processes remains indispensable. The catalyst segment currently accounts for <strong>62% of total mordenite consumption</strong>, as refiners seek to optimize fuel yields amid tightening environmental regulations.</p><p><strong>2. Environmental Remediation Demand:</strong><br>
Mordenite's ion-exchange properties make it ideal for wastewater treatment, particularly in removing heavy metals. The water treatment chemicals market, valued at <strong>USD 39.5 billion in 2023</strong>, is adopting mordenite at a <strong>5.8% annual rate</strong> due to its superior selectivity for cadmium and lead ions.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
