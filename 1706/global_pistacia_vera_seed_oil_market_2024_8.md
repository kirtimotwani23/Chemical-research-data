While European markets currently dominate with <strong>38% global share</strong>, the MEA and APAC regions are witnessing accelerated growth at <strong>CAGRs of 8.1% and 7.5% respectively</strong>.

Clinical Skincare Applications:</strong><br>
Research indicates pistachio oil's <strong>high squalene content (6-8%)</strong> shows promise in mitigating atopic dermatitis symptoms, with trial participants showing <strong>54% reduction in irritation markers</strong>. This positions the ingredient strongly in the USD 4.9 billion therapeutic dermocosmetics sector.</p><p><strong>2. Sustainable Sourcing Initiatives:</strong><br>
With <strong>76% of beauty consumers</strong> prioritizing sustainability, brands are implementing blockchain-tracked supply chains from Mediterranean orchards.
